# Deployment

Deployment can be performed in two ways:

1. **Local Deployment**: This is the simplest way to deploy the application. You can deploy the application on your local machine and access it using the browser. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

2. **Cloud Deployment**: This is the most common way to deploy the application. You can deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. This is useful for production purposes.

## Local Deployment

For simplicity we will work locally.

We will deploy deploy the model as a REST-API endpoint using Flask.
